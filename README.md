  ## Description:
  Workout tracking is a great way to stay motivated and hold yourself accountable. To assist with this process this workout tracker was created. When viewing the app online, a user is met with a page that allows them to log a new workout or if a workout has been created, will allow the user to continue a workout. From either option, the user will be prompted to select the type of work out (resistance or cardio) and fill out the corresponding inputs to further log their workout. Once completed, a user is able to look at their process by viewing the dashboard.

  ## Installation:
  To download the application, you must install dependencies. These include express, mongo, mongojs, mongoose, and morgan. Each will allow the inputs to be collected and stored within a local mongoDB called workout or on the mongo Atlas.  

  ## Usage:
  To start, each back-end route needed to be linked to their corresponding front end CRUD calls. All of these were stored within the api route and relies on express and mongojs to grab data and read data from the database.
